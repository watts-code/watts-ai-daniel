- Human Potential Audio Foundation (Esalen archives, rare cassettes)

**Key Differentiators:**
- Verified, high-fidelity content from original recordings
- Rare/exclusive materials (Esalen recordings, unreleased tapes)
- AI-simulated conversations between figures who never met
- Near-zero latency querying entire library
- "River guides" (AI curators like "Samantha") for discovery

**Content Protection:**
- Cautious about voice cloning and unauthorized use
- Defensive strategies against YouTube/motivational misappropriation
- Non-exclusive licenses for flexibility

### Technology

**Justin's System:**
- Siloed, targeted AI-driven library query
- Natural interaction with content and AI personas
