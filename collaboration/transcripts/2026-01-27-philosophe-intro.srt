Justin Charles: Good.

Justin Charles: Yeah.

60
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,430
Justin Charles: Yeah.

61
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,150
Justin Charles: So, actually, one of my friends was, like, the basketball manager in that video.

62
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,230
Justin Charles: He works for a private equity fund now.

63
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,550
Justin Charles: And then Steph's.

64
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:59,230
Justin Charles: So Steph's roommate, David Simmons, this guy Brian Barr, who was, like, a math genius and ran data analytics at Nike, and I think he is now, like, kind of just, like, runs Steph's, like, private affairs.

65
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,310
Justin Charles: So it's kind of funny.

66
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,310
Justin Charles: Like, there's like, a whole orbit of Step where all the guys are, like, still connected to him.

67
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,590
Daniel Shanklin: Cool.

68
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,470

Justin Charles: Well.

71
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,630
Daniel Shanklin: Well, you lived in a good spot.

72
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,910
Daniel Shanklin: Asheville's a. I lived there for one year, and.

73
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,390
Daniel Shanklin: And then they.

74
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,030
Daniel Shanklin: And then they passed, like, reparations, and I was like, I'm out of here.

75
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,990
Justin Charles: Oh, really?

76
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,790
Daniel Shanklin: Oh, yeah.

77
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,150
Daniel Shanklin: I was like, I've had enough.

78
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,990
Justin Charles: Colin, have you met Jack?

79
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,230
Justin Charles: I don't think I have.

80
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,950
Justin Charles: I don't think so.

81
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,830
Jack Quinlan: Not yet.

82
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:29,830
Justin Charles: Yeah.

83
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,750
Collin Bird - AIC: Good to meet you, Jack.

84
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,110
Jack Quinlan: Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

85
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:45,720
Justin Charles: So, Jack, I. I know from pre Permian he is in the process of joining us, and he's moving to Dallas in, like, two weeks from D.C. so.

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,360
Justin Charles: So, yeah.

87
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,160
Justin Charles: And Daniel.

88
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,840
Justin Charles: Nice to meet you, Daniel.

89
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,320
Justin Charles: Jack.

90
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
Justin Charles: So I think the.

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,640
Justin Charles: The purpose of this call is to figure out how.

92
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,640
Justin Charles: How we can work together.

93
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:06,760
Justin Charles: On this philosophy project, I don't really have, like, a specific.

94
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Justin Charles: I can give you data if it's helpful.

95
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,790
Justin Charles: I can, like, give you an overview of what we're attempting to make.

96
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,550
Justin Charles: I don't know how familiar you are with it.

97
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,030
Justin Charles: And then we can show you.

98
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,830
Justin Charles: And I can send you what we've done with Alan Watts so far, because a lot of this is like a port of.

99
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,910
Justin Charles: Of what we did with Alan.

100
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,110
Justin Charles: And then happy to figure out, like, how it makes the most sense to integrate you into this.

101
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,030
Collin Bird - AIC: Yeah.

102
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,840
Collin Bird - AIC: And I'm sure Justin, like, look, Alex and I appreciate that y' all have.

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Collin Bird - AIC: Both you, Daniel and Jack have day jobs.

104
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:40,960
Justin Charles: Right.

105
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Collin Bird - AIC: And this is kind of a side project.

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,400
Collin Bird - AIC: So this is to the extent that you want more people under the tent to help build this app.

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
Collin Bird - AIC: I think Daniel been.

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,040
Collin Bird - AIC: He's only been with us for four months now, maybe a little more, but he's been a good builder.

109
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Collin Bird - AIC: I think he's a good thinker about these kind of things.

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,920
Collin Bird - AIC: And so, you know, we just wanted to give you another resource.

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,480
Collin Bird - AIC: But as far as, like, product management goes and what needs to be done, that's you as far as I'm concerned.

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Collin Bird - AIC: So, you know, we're here.

113
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Collin Bird - AIC: We just want to be a resource and kind of help out where we can.

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,120
Daniel Shanklin: Okay.

115
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,959
Justin Charles: Yeah, I mean, that sounds great.

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,959
Justin Charles: So maybe I give you.

117
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,800
Justin Charles: Daniel, let me give you, like, a quick demo of Watts.

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,760
Daniel Shanklin: Sure.

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Justin Charles: Just going to pull it up here.

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Justin Charles: So.

121
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Justin Charles: And I'm.

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,640
Justin Charles: I'm assuming you're familiar with.

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
Justin Charles: I think I shared that on the screen.

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Justin Charles: One sec.

125
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Jack Quinlan: I can see.

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
Justin Charles: Is this Alan Watts?

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,760
Justin Charles: Okay.

128
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Justin Charles: Yeah.

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,920
Justin Charles: Okay.

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,760
Justin Charles: Daniel, how familiar are you with Alan Watts?

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,030
Daniel Shanklin: I did some reading on him a few years ago, and then after all this started, I went off and read some more.

132
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,510
Daniel Shanklin: But other than ever, other than I went to massage school back in 2016.

133
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,550
Daniel Shanklin: I think they talked about him then, but I've since left the tribe and I need a refresher.

134
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,350
Justin Charles: Yeah.

135
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,710
Justin Charles: So he's.

136
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,190
Justin Charles: He's essentially one of these.

137
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,790
Justin Charles: I guess you could put him in the spiritual guru bucket.

138
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,790
Justin Charles: Like, does a bunch of.

139
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,710
Justin Charles: Had done a bunch of talks.

140
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,550
Justin Charles: Very interesting guy.

141
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Justin Charles: Passed away in the 70s, and his son Mark has really become the steward of all things Alan Watts.

142
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,830
Justin Charles: There's a foundation.

143
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,870
Justin Charles: And so what we did was as like a kind of like a test project.

144
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,190
Justin Charles: We built this little app that basically takes all of Mark's.

145
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:49,120
Justin Charles: The content repository that Mark has of Alan's works, Whether it's text, MP3, you know, audio or video.

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Justin Charles: And we've built this Little app where you can go in here and basically say like, you know, you could ask whatever you want, but what would Alan Watts say is the meaning of life, right?

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,980
Justin Charles: And then it will essentially search the content for semantic understanding and then respond with answer and then cited sources.

148
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,500
Justin Charles: And then we've done a lot of work on like the visual workflow of, you know, it's citing this audio lecture.

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:33,460
Justin Charles: So if you click it will bring you right to it and then it will bring you exactly to the point of the transcript that it is citing from.

150
00:06:33,940 --> 00:07:00,920
Justin Charles: And then as you play the content, you know, it will kind of scroll the transcript so you can keep track of where you are in the talk and then you can jump around and then on the left hand side, it keeps track of, you know, all the content, what you've watched, what you haven't, you know, has video and it's kind of all plugged into to this chat app.

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,360
Justin Charles: And so we can talk more about how we did this and we'd love to get your thoughts because I think that's probably more your area of expertise.

152
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:22,330
Justin Charles: But our plan is to essentially take this look for philosophy AI add the ability to have multiple kind of gurus.

153
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,330
Justin Charles: So in addition to Alan, you would have Deepak Chopra.

154
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,210
Justin Charles: So if you are Rav Das or whoever.

155
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:43,830
Justin Charles: So if you ask, in this chat, you could have very different types of experiences, such as like, hey, I want to know more about the meaning of life.

156
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,150
Justin Charles: Like summarize what Alan, Deepak would have to say.

157
00:07:47,150 --> 00:08:05,380
Justin Charles: Or maybe like Alan and Deepak have a, a discussion or we make like a long form podcast episode for your ride to work where it's like a synthetic version of Alan Watts's voice and Deepak's voice, like having a conversation about their views on the meaning of life, right?

158
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:14,980
Justin Charles: And like the whole idea is to basically build an experience that is a conduit.

159
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:25,060
Justin Charles: And in this case, like how we built the Watts experiences, it's really more so this chat experiences Samantha, which is designed to be your river guide to all things Alan Watts.

160
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,100
Justin Charles: So maybe it has many different vectors.

161
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,799
Justin Charles: One vector is like the river guide to the content from all of these people.

162
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,320
Justin Charles: Maybe another version is you can create your own tribunal.

163
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,200
Justin Charles: So I guess I can pull up Jack's slides as well.

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Justin Charles: We've done some little mock ups, but maybe in this chat box you could click like, hey, I want to have a conversation about this.

165
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,480
Justin Charles: And I'm going to click like, I want to be Alan Watson Ram Dass, right?

166
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,430
Justin Charles: And Then it will only refer to like those two pieces of content or you know, respond and then is it a river guide?

167
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,510
Justin Charles: Is it Alan's voice?

168
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,710
Justin Charles: Like those are all the things we're kind of figuring out.

169
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,750
Justin Charles: And then the last thing that we have here is we just have this quick search feature.

170
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:15,070
Justin Charles: So you can search for any piece of content and it will search semantically so not just for keywords.

171
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,710
Justin Charles: So it's looking for like the semantic relevance.

172
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,110
Justin Charles: So for example, there's this very famous Alan Watts story called the maybe story.

173
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,310
Justin Charles: And you know, he uses the word maybe in the story, but it's not explicitly called the maybe story anywhere.

174
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:35,910
Justin Charles: So I use this as an example because it's really like a, it's a story about a Chinese man and his son, but it's not called the maybe story.

175
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,950
Justin Charles: So that's what we have.

176
00:09:40,070 --> 00:10:06,110
Justin Charles: And like I said, where we're going is we want to make this multi guru with much richer, much broader set of experiences and like a very slick consumer facing UI and probably an app that's really kind of like designed to be almost like a shared media platform.

177
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,510
Daniel Shanklin: Yep.

178
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,190
Daniel Shanklin: Okay, that's a great intro for it.

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,560
Daniel Shanklin: What's like one thing you had on your mind that you thought I could help with?

180
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,920
Daniel Shanklin: Anything in particular?

181
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:32,120
Justin Charles: I think what would be helpful is to like understand better like what your maybe strengths are because then we can figure out where it makes most sense to include you in it.

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Daniel Shanklin: Sure.

183
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,920
Daniel Shanklin: The thing I was the strongest at is going away software engineering.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
Daniel Shanklin: Bye bye, adios, won't need us anymore.

185
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,720
Daniel Shanklin: So yeah, there you go.

186
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,840
Justin Charles: So.

187
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Daniel Shanklin: But I've never rested on that.

188
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,680
Daniel Shanklin: So I was a trader at a hedge fund.

189
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Daniel Shanklin: I've been an accountant at a hedge fund.

190
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
Daniel Shanklin: I've done startups, I did ticket arbitrage in Vegas.

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
Daniel Shanklin: So like I'm the weird guy who's like let's just go make it up and let's see what happens.

192
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,960
Daniel Shanklin: And so like AI is actually perfect for that.

193
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:11,560
Daniel Shanklin: And I love what you've already put together because I don't care how polished it is, it's just you just get started on an idea and you just keep going down that road.

194
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,440
Daniel Shanklin: Nerd talk though.

195
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:23,560
Daniel Shanklin: I have studied AI at a couple different grad programs so like I understand how it works underneath the hood, like why you would want to choose a specific type of rag technology.

196
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Daniel Shanklin: Here's one we can remember this for the recording.

197
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Daniel Shanklin: Is anybody recording this?

198
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
Daniel Shanklin: I should be recording this.

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,800
Justin Charles: Yeah, I think Collins note taker is recording it.

200
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,450
Daniel Shanklin: Sure.

201
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,570
Collin Bird - AIC: I'M recording it, Daniel.

202
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,450
Daniel Shanklin: Thank you, man.

203
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:40,210
Daniel Shanklin: Okay, so like, there's a reverse rank fusion rrf.

204
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:46,010
Daniel Shanklin: So when you do search, you don't just search using vectorization, but you use three different search types.

205
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:53,170
Daniel Shanklin: So you got like keyword search, you got your dense vector, and then you have a sparse vector, which we learned Google figured out from PageRank.

206
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,250
Daniel Shanklin: And then once you combine all those three, what happens is it returns the top results.

207
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,830
Daniel Shanklin: The computer looks at those and goes, actually, the best result based on the top five here is actually number three.

208
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,310
Daniel Shanklin: And then it puts that to the top.

209
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,950
Daniel Shanklin: All of this happening in milliseconds.

210
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,350
Daniel Shanklin: To me, to win an AI, you have to do that stuff, right?

211
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,670
Daniel Shanklin: Because everyone else is going to make the same app.

212
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,750
Daniel Shanklin: So it's like, if you can really nail that part of it.

213
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,550
Daniel Shanklin: Have you ever used Perplexity, for example?

214
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,110
Jack Quinlan: Yeah.

215
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,590
Daniel Shanklin: It'S my personal favorite.

216
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,430
Daniel Shanklin: It's super fast.

217
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,710
Daniel Shanklin: It's one of the most accurate.

218
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,500
Daniel Shanklin: They just figured out that part of it.

219
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Daniel Shanklin: And so, like, an app that's engaging is going to be really quick.

220
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,020
Daniel Shanklin: I'm not claiming everything I build is quick, but I do think that's true.

221
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,540
Justin Charles: So.

222
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,900
Justin Charles: No, that's great background.

223
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,580
Justin Charles: So maybe a little more here.

224
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,460
Justin Charles: So what we did was Mark gave us like a raw.

225
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,580
Justin Charles: Mark gave us the RAW MP3s and the videos.

226
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,995
Justin Charles: And then what we did was we ran it through Amazon Transcribe.

227
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,240
Justin Charles: So, so first things first.

228
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,560
Justin Charles: Like, I'm primarily.

229
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,640
Justin Charles: I mean, I think everybody, like I'm Python Jack is Python and Typescript.

230
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,080
Justin Charles: So Next js, we're big fans of Next js.

231
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,720
Justin Charles: So what we did was we took all of the.

232
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,680
Justin Charles: We took all the RAW files and we made a Python pipeline to Amazon Transcribe them.

233
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:25,910
Justin Charles: And I don't know if you've ever seen an Amazon transcribe output, but it gives you like the text, so it responds in JSON and it gives you like the block of text.

234
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:34,390
Justin Charles: But then down below it gives you every word in the transcript with a millisecond timestamp of when in the content it occurred.

235
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,110
Justin Charles: And then from there what we did was we chunked it up into.

236
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,430
Justin Charles: I think it's like block.

237
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,990
Justin Charles: It's very unsophisticated.

238
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,830
Justin Charles: It's like blocks of like five sentences.

239
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,110
Justin Charles: And then we ingested that into we v8.

240
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:57,870
Justin Charles: So I played around a little bit, like very primitively with like different encoders and, or vectorizers and different databases.

241
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,590
Justin Charles: So I tried like Elastic and some of Amazon stuff.

242
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,030
Jack Quinlan: Sure.

243
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,390
Daniel Shanklin: We.

244
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,670
Justin Charles: We was just like far and away the best So I think we found that.

245
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,190
Justin Charles: I'm trying to remember the name of the vectorizer we used.

246
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,790
Justin Charles: Is it.

247
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,310
Justin Charles: It's the random Man.

248
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,710
Justin Charles: I can't even remember Jack.

249
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,750
Justin Charles: Do you remember what it's called?

250
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,610
Jack Quinlan: I can, I can pull it up.

251
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,130
Justin Charles: I don't remember.

252
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:27,370
Justin Charles: Anyway, we found like the a vector that worked pretty well and then we chunked it into sections of five sentences and then we put that into eviate.

253
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:35,930
Justin Charles: And then like we use LangChain to build an agent that's basically like, you're Samantha, you're Alan Watts's river guide.

254
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,210
Justin Charles: You know, here's an incoming query and then we literally just send that query straight to.

255
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,660
Justin Charles: Straight to.

256
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,140
Justin Charles: Straight to weaviate, which has like a semantic and keyword engine.

257
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,340
Daniel Shanklin: Yep.

258
00:14:50,580 --> 00:15:01,060
Justin Charles: And then it responds with like the end most relevant content and we return answer.

259
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:15,600
Justin Charles: So everything you're talking about is something that we've spent like, basically we spent as much time as I explained, which is like probably maybe the full working week equivalent of like one or two weeks.

260
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,480
Justin Charles: And I'd say like what Jack is building now.

261
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,240
Justin Charles: And it's relative by the way.

262
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,120
Justin Charles: What's that?

263
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, it is hard, by the way.

264
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
Daniel Shanklin: Like, yeah, if you struggle with it, everybody is.

265
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
Justin Charles: So yeah, I mean, I was surprised.

266
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,480
Justin Charles: Like, I tried it.

267
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,200
Justin Charles: So I tried.

268
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Justin Charles: I guess I also tried like the.

269
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,400
Justin Charles: I think OpenAI has something where you just give them the content and then like they index it and like it was total garbage.

270
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,820
Justin Charles: And.

271
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,810
Justin Charles: And then Elastic was very bad because they are trying to do this BM25.

272
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,330
Justin Charles: It was horrifically bad.

273
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:48,570
Justin Charles: Then I tried Amazon's Knowledge graph where they have it in Bedrock so you can just take it from S3.

274
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,690
Justin Charles: And that was bad.

275
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,610
Justin Charles: Then we tried weaviate and I was like, wow, that's actually really good.

276
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,090
Justin Charles: It just works really well.

277
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,770
Justin Charles: But I didn't spend a lot of time on it.

278
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:11,500
Justin Charles: Then Jack really built out the UI and the interface where we're at right now is Jack is just Claude coding like a multi ported version of the Python pipeline and the interface.

279
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,980
Justin Charles: And that probably shouldn't take that long.

280
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:21,180
Justin Charles: But everything that you just explained is like stuff that we know nothing about and also probably where we can make it better.

281
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,900
Daniel Shanklin: So yeah, here's where it gets, here's where AI gets crazy, right?

282
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,180
Daniel Shanklin: Like, all I have to do is tip you off to a couple URLs and you guys are off.

283
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,240
Daniel Shanklin: So like I shared one just now.

284
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,560
Daniel Shanklin: It's a paper put out by Google about a month or two ago.

285
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:44,440
Daniel Shanklin: They talk about how dense vectorization or the typical embedding trick that most people have been using for years, it actually doesn't work past, like, a hundred rows, which is crazy.

286
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
Daniel Shanklin: But, like, they proved it.

287
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:53,320
Daniel Shanklin: And so that's why you have to get into these, like we call, ensemble techniques, where you use multiple search techniques at the same time.

288
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,560
Daniel Shanklin: I'm happy to share my algorithm that I use for that.

289
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,720
Daniel Shanklin: I mean, it's not worth anything.

290
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,290
Daniel Shanklin: but, like, literally, I.

291
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,010
Daniel Shanklin: This problem of search is everywhere because AI creates unlimited data, but it doesn't actually do a great job of, like, pulling it back.

292
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,329
Daniel Shanklin: That's the thing it's terrible at.

293
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,410
Daniel Shanklin: The other thing I would mention is, so here at aic, we have a.

294
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,290
Daniel Shanklin: When this call is done, we got a call eater.

295
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,530
Daniel Shanklin: It'll go out and grab this.

296
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,210
Daniel Shanklin: It's a web hook that comes from Fireflies, sends it over to our server.

297
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,010
Daniel Shanklin: But the other thing I added was a glossary.

298
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:36,119
Daniel Shanklin: And so this glossary has all these different entities that it can use so that when we get that call in, if he says spy, that's spy SP5, you know, S&P500.

299
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,319
Justin Charles: Not like.

300
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,839
Daniel Shanklin: Like a spy with a looking glass, you know?

301
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,279
Daniel Shanklin: And so it understands these things based on our glossary.

302
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,079
Daniel Shanklin: I was curious if y' all had a glossary during transcription.

303
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:46,959
Justin Charles: No, we.

304
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:50,770
Justin Charles: We literally Amazon transcribed it, which is fine.

305
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,850
Daniel Shanklin: I just thought I'd.

306
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,050
Daniel Shanklin: These are, like, when you're looking for that thing that takes it to the next level, this is kind of some of the stuff that I typically look for.

307
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:58,970
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah.

308
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,410
Daniel Shanklin: Myself.

309
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,370
Daniel Shanklin: And it's not like.

310
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,970
Daniel Shanklin: None of that is, like, out of the box.

311
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,610
Daniel Shanklin: It's kind of like how the pros are doing it.

312
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,170
Daniel Shanklin: That's all.

313
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,690
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, I actually.

314
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,050
Daniel Shanklin: I actually built one, and I'll show you, and it's got a doc in there.

315
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,450
Daniel Shanklin: This is.

316
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,490
Daniel Shanklin: This is free of charge.

317
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,810
Daniel Shanklin: Here we go.

318
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,250
Daniel Shanklin: Watts Jet Intelligence.

319
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,570
Daniel Shanklin: Com.

320
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,490
Daniel Shanklin: Super simple Alan Watts Chat.

321
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:24,270
Daniel Shanklin: It's very similar to what y' all did, but inside of there is a technology page, and you can go read about how I use loops and reinforcement learning.

322
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:34,270
Daniel Shanklin: And the way it works is you actually have Claude code, have a chat with your app, and then score it on how it's doing on a first pass.

323
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:41,990
Daniel Shanklin: And then you have it keep running until it boosts the system prompts to a better place, if that makes sense.

324
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,590
Daniel Shanklin: You're basically saying, I know you're supposed to be Watts, but you're not doing a very good job right now.

325
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,310
Justin Charles: Yeah.

326
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,830
Daniel Shanklin: You have this outside observer that keeps putting it through a loop.

327
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,150
Daniel Shanklin: I write about that here in this Document as well.

328
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,430
Daniel Shanklin: Anything else that.

329
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,510
Daniel Shanklin: I mean, I'm just kind of spitballing here.

330
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,110
Justin Charles: Yeah, I mean, I think.

331
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,070
Justin Charles: Well, one question.

332
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,150
Justin Charles: Like, you talked about rag.

333
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,790
Justin Charles: Like, have you spent.

334
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,990
Justin Charles: I'm sure you spent more than us.

335
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:19,890
Justin Charles: Like, if I were to say this is what we're building, what I just described, like, which database, and you alluded to the rag technique, but, I mean, we're debating, like, should we just nix weaviate?

336
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,490
Justin Charles: Have you tried postgres at all?

337
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,690
Daniel Shanklin: Like, yeah, we use postgres with PG Vector, which is there.

338
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,170
Daniel Shanklin: It's just a plugin that puts the vector over into a column.

339
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,890
Daniel Shanklin: That's what we use for 90% of the stuff.

340
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,650
Daniel Shanklin: I don't use pinecone.

341
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,070
Daniel Shanklin: I mean, I used it, like, a year and a half ago, but I just haven't had a needle.

342
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,780
Daniel Shanklin: It is my opinion that the more you put everything in the same server, the better off you are in the AI, which is.

343
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,100
Justin Charles: I want to get rid of weaviate.

344
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,700
Justin Charles: It's just, like, it works so well that I didn't want to mess with it again.

345
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,980
Justin Charles: So I'm wondering if you can help us, like, port the wat.

346
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,860
Justin Charles: Well, I mean, so what we could use your help with, I think, very obviously.

347
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,500
Justin Charles: And, like, maybe we just do it on the WhatsApp first, or.

348
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,140
Justin Charles: I mean, I'll leave this to Jack and to.

349
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:15,340
Justin Charles: To you, Daniel, but, like, if you can help us, maybe do a better job just nixing weate, getting it onto postgress.

350
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,300
Justin Charles: Sure.

351
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,780
Justin Charles: And then.

352
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:31,320
Justin Charles: And then, like, doing the rag and the chunking and the vectorization and all that stuff really well, that would be extremely helpful because I think, like.

353
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:41,000
Justin Charles: And, you know, Jack, you know, Jax is very strong at, you know, building next JS code that works and is clean and easy to use.

354
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,720
Justin Charles: Like, that's very clearly his strength.

355
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Justin Charles: I'd say, like, you definitely have a very important piece of it that, like, I don't have.

356
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
Justin Charles: And Jack is kind of learning, so.

357
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,040
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, well, I.

358
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,400
Daniel Shanklin: It's funny because we have another person.

359
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,650
Daniel Shanklin: So Collins Co. Swallowed me whole, which was.

360
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,610
Daniel Shanklin: Which was fantastic.

361
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,650
Daniel Shanklin: I needed some sun.

362
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,770
Daniel Shanklin: But one of our senior AI engineers at AIC has been with me for over a year and a half.

363
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,450
Daniel Shanklin: He's better at front end than I am.

364
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,290
Daniel Shanklin: He will do next JS faster.

365
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,290
Daniel Shanklin: So I went the other route and was like, what are all the back end things about AI that you really need to master to really, like, get this right?

366
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,930
Daniel Shanklin: And as you know, it's like, everyone's like, oh, it's a solved problem.

367
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,890
Daniel Shanklin: No, it's Just the next.

368
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,730
Daniel Shanklin: We have this next problem now.

369
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,290
Daniel Shanklin: We get the next year of our lives to figure out how to get AI to work.

370
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,850
Daniel Shanklin: So I'd be happy to help with that if you want to do it over GitHub.

371
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,770
Daniel Shanklin: That's a really easy way sometimes if I want to share ideas with somebody else.

372
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,890
Daniel Shanklin: I'll give you a quick example.

373
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,530
Daniel Shanklin: I shit you not.

374
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,730
Daniel Shanklin: I have a house in Boone and I'm renting it to this guy who's a software developer.

375
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,810
Daniel Shanklin: So he and I made a repo of the house.

376
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,850
Justin Charles: Okay.

377
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,690
Daniel Shanklin: And then went back and forth and we had a contract.

378
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,970
Daniel Shanklin: So his cursor versus my Claude code.

379
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,020
Daniel Shanklin: This is the new way we work.

380
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,340
Daniel Shanklin: If you didn't want to give me your data, but you just wanted to give me the architecture, you could create a new repo and stick it in there.

381
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,260
Daniel Shanklin: Be like, here, Daniel.

382
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,540
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah.

383
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:09,700
Justin Charles: No, we can add you to the Watts GitHub and you can take a look at it, because as long as that's why I'm calling.

384
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,260
Justin Charles: Colin is involved in the whole Watts project anyway, so I don't know why that would be a problem.

385
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,700
Justin Charles: Okay.

386
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,860
Daniel Shanklin: Hey, one other thing I can tell you about.

387
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,300
Daniel Shanklin: We built a piece of software here called Artemis, and it's not worth anything.

388
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:33,260
Daniel Shanklin: But what it does, it takes in all of your AI calls from anywhere and then it logs them all, by app and by user, and then it sends them out to either anthropic OpenAI or open router.

389
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,380
Daniel Shanklin: And so it's a counter.

390
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,340
Daniel Shanklin: It's an odometer for your AI.

391
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:45,340
Daniel Shanklin: You may need something like that because I was reading your contract that you're going to have to split up for this philosophy project based on tokens.

392
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,660
Daniel Shanklin: Right.

393
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,780
Justin Charles: Yeah.

394
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:56,610
Justin Charles: So far we've only used bedrock just for the convenience of, like, knowing that there's no logging and all that stuff going on, or, like, model training.

395
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,730
Justin Charles: Very smart.

396
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:58,890
Justin Charles: Yeah.

397
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,530
Justin Charles: Do you have a.

398
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,930
Daniel Shanklin: Do you have a middleware that captures your tokens or logs it yet?

399
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,890
Justin Charles: We've wrote some of that by hand for Permian purposes.

400
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,530
Justin Charles: So, like, the short answer is like, kind of, but very primitively, but that would be very helpful if you can.

401
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,810
Justin Charles: If you can share that.

402
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,210
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, I mean, it's really just a technique, and that's what I'd be happy to share for sure.

403
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,970
Daniel Shanklin: Okay.

404
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,450
Daniel Shanklin: And you're in Dallas.

405
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,410
Justin Charles: Yes.

406
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,770
Jack Quinlan: Okay, cool.

407
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,610
Daniel Shanklin: And Jack, you're in dc, Is that right?

408
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,770
Jack Quinlan: DC for.

409
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,250
Jack Quinlan: Yeah, two weeks from Thursday.

410
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,970
Jack Quinlan: I'll be in Dallas and then they're moving you out.

411
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,530
Daniel Shanklin: All right.

412
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,090
Collin Bird - AIC: Yeah.

413
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,330
Daniel Shanklin: Were you a lobbyist?

414
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,210
Daniel Shanklin: We on the X Files?

415
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:39,890
Daniel Shanklin: What are we doing there?

416
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,690
Jack Quinlan: No, I went to school here.

417
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,320
Jack Quinlan: Cool.

418
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,000
Jack Quinlan: I worked.

419
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,240
Jack Quinlan: Got my first job here.

420
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,720
Jack Quinlan: That's where I met Justin and yeah, pulled me over to Permian, which I'm super excited about.

421
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,840
Jack Quinlan: Okay, cool.

422
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
Daniel Shanklin: All right, well, I.

423
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:11,200
Daniel Shanklin: Look, I think you guys have done a really, I think you've done a really interesting job with the foldering and I think this is like, I don't know why other people haven't figured out this UX yet, but if your chats don't have folders like that, I don't know how you're supposed to keep up with this.

424
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,310
Daniel Shanklin: Is that crazy?

425
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,710
Justin Charles: So that's all Jack?

426
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,670
Justin Charles: I think, I think it's really good, honestly.

427
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,590
Justin Charles: Yeah, I think it's really impressive.

428
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,910
Justin Charles: So.

429
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,030
Justin Charles: Yeah, I agree.

430
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,870
Justin Charles: How about, how about we add you.

431
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,230
Justin Charles: Thank you.

432
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,950
Justin Charles: How about we add you to the Watts GitHub and then we'll add you to the.

433
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:41,140
Justin Charles: We haven't created the philosophy one yet, but we'll add it, we'll add you to it and then you can take a look and like, you know, clog code through our stuff and just give us some.

434
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Justin Charles: You we can find another time for all of us to hop back on.

435
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:52,100
Justin Charles: But, you know, for you to maybe just teach us better ways to do this.

436
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,220
Collin Bird - AIC: No problem.

437
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,340
Daniel Shanklin: I'll be upfront about something.

438
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,020
Daniel Shanklin: I've drank the cold.

439
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,060
Daniel Shanklin: Just as many have drank the Watts Kool Aid.

440
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,500
Daniel Shanklin: I've drank the Claude code Kool Aid.

441
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,740
Daniel Shanklin: So I really don't write code much anymore if that's an expectation, you know.

442
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,940
Justin Charles: No, no, I, I clog code.

443
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:18,220
Justin Charles: I mean, I used to write a lot and like review a lot and now I cloud code and I think Jack is like increasingly cloud coding more so.

444
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Justin Charles: Yeah, I mean we're, we're in the same boat.

445
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:36,910
Justin Charles: And you know, I think like also sharing, you know, what you learned on that, like, we're pretty primitive inside of premium just because we have so many compliance constraints that like, it's very hard to like, you know, just throw up MCPS and stuff.

446
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:48,270
Justin Charles: But you know, I think especially for this, like, and we're all ears for any tips and what I was telling Jack is I think we should make.

447
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:54,990
Justin Charles: I don't know if you've used it, but I guess everyone loves linear now, which is like a better like JIRA project board.

448
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:07,430
Justin Charles: And so I'm kind of feeling like the way to do it is to just have a linear board and to basically spec out and build all of the tickets and then just let Claude kind of rip through them and review them and make changes.

449
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,110
Justin Charles: I don't know how you're doing that now.

450
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,950
Daniel Shanklin: You're 100% right.

451
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:16,710
Daniel Shanklin: So for my own personal projects, I built my own linear so that like it's all local, it's just fast.

452
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:24,230
Daniel Shanklin: But for AIC stuff, we actually use GitHub issues and projects and then we build a custom MCP that reads and writes to those.

453
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,260
Daniel Shanklin: What this means is that we don't have to maintain external software for project management.

454
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,300
Daniel Shanklin: And I'll just literally be like, go rip on this whole project.

455
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,820
Daniel Shanklin: And it's like, you know, so pretty impressive.

456
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,460
Justin Charles: So we use GitHub projects as well for Permian and for Watts.

457
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,060
Justin Charles: So maybe we just keep it there and like, if you'd be game to, you know.

458
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,340
Daniel Shanklin: Sure.

459
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,620
Daniel Shanklin: I do love linear.

460
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,460
Daniel Shanklin: Don't get me wrong.

461
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,180
Daniel Shanklin: If you decide to go, I'm just.

462
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,980
Justin Charles: Not a big fan of like having eight tools if I can help it, you know.

463
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,530
Justin Charles: Agree.

464
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,170
Justin Charles: So like, maybe we'll just stick to GitHub, but if, you know, we should just schedule another 30 minutes where we go through all things tech.

465
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,050
Justin Charles: And if you want to show Jack and I how you're doing the GitHub MCP so we can do the same.

466
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:19,930
Justin Charles: Like, I think probably the first thing is just like educating us on how we could be more efficient with our engineering time would probably be the first step and then second step would be teaching us how to do rag really well.

467
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, I'd be happy to.

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,360
Daniel Shanklin: So just kind of in closing, we'll do like mafia here.

469
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
Daniel Shanklin: I'd be happy to help you guys with this.

470
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,280
Daniel Shanklin: My thing is I'd started this month, it's been around for a year.

471
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,480
Daniel Shanklin: But I just were one of those robots, you know that one X Neo.

472
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,160
Jack Quinlan: Yeah, yeah.

473
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:48,680
Daniel Shanklin: But I don't have much to clean, so I'm starting a non profit where I put the robot in the nonprofit and then I have people in tech take it to people's houses and like clean up.

474
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,960
Daniel Shanklin: So it's like a disabled vet or a single mom or something.

475
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,300
Daniel Shanklin: You know, it's like a new form of, you know, volunteerism.

476
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,220
Daniel Shanklin: And it's easy to get volunteers because they all want to work with the robot.

477
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,500
Daniel Shanklin: Right.

478
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,940
Daniel Shanklin: So just cold pitch, that's what I'm working on.

479
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,420
Daniel Shanklin: You know, anybody wants to help me out with that in the DFW area, that's fine.

480
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,540
Daniel Shanklin: But I love to trade on that and say, yeah, let me help you out with your Project.

481
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,100
Daniel Shanklin: No problem.

482
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,740
Justin Charles: Okay.

483
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,580
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah.

484
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:10,980
Jack Quinlan: Awesome.

485
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,660
Justin Charles: What exactly do you need help with that with.

486
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,940
Justin Charles: With respect to that.

487
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,140
Daniel Shanklin: It's on the recording now, and you've heard of it, so, like, at some point, and it was like.

488
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,300
Daniel Shanklin: Like a Mafia bus.

489
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,320
Daniel Shanklin: At some point in the future, I sure.

490
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,880
Daniel Shanklin: I'm sure something will come up and you'll be like, oh, I know somebody doing that.

491
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, that's okay.

492
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,800
Daniel Shanklin: And if I wake up and.

493
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,080
Daniel Shanklin: And.

494
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,200
Daniel Shanklin: And I've been suffocated, somebody.

495
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,840
Daniel Shanklin: One of y' all hacked it with your GitHub.

496
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,280
Daniel Shanklin: I swear.

497
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,720
Justin Charles: Got it.

498
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,520
Daniel Shanklin: Are you still hanging out?

499
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Daniel Shanklin: He's busy.

500
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,520
Daniel Shanklin: He's got, like, six things going on.

501
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,720
Collin Bird - AIC: Yeah, I. I am still here.

502
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,160
Collin Bird - AIC: We just.

503
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,400
Collin Bird - AIC: We did a late lunch with our family, so.

504
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,210
Collin Bird - AIC: Wrapping up.

505
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:54,810
Justin Charles: All right.

506
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,330
Justin Charles: Yeah.

507
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,610
Daniel Shanklin: I think.

508
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,570
Justin Charles: You want us to do it for you?

509
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,450
Collin Bird - AIC: No, I think this is exactly what I wanted, kind of.

510
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,050
Collin Bird - AIC: You guys talk about the back end, right?

511
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,810
Collin Bird - AIC: Like, how you're chunking those files and talk the rag.

512
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:10,890
Collin Bird - AIC: Stuff that I don't know much about and best practices.

513
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,450
Collin Bird - AIC: So it's good.

514
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:12,970
Daniel Shanklin: Okay.

515
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,690
Collin Bird - AIC: I think we'll share the GitHub and do little meetings.

516
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,860
Daniel Shanklin: All right, cool.

517
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,300
Jack Quinlan: Sounds good.

518
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,820
Daniel Shanklin: Well, it's like.

519
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,620
Daniel Shanklin: It's like Elon said, there's no IP anymore.

520
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,100
Daniel Shanklin: There's just speed, so.

521
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,740
Justin Charles: Yeah, I know.

522
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:30,020
Justin Charles: I think that's the hard part is, like, I'm just trying to increasingly figure out how we do this with, like, kind of minimal humans.

523
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,180
Daniel Shanklin: Completely agree.

524
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,220
Justin Charles: Yeah.

525
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:47,640
Collin Bird - AIC: And we've talked to a couple other gurus that are trying to do their own thing with AI, so, like, obviously not that creative of a thing to do, but this is more about speed and getting three or four big names in one spot.

526
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,120
Collin Bird - AIC: And hopefully that gravity pulls everyone else in.

527
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,520
Daniel Shanklin: Yeah, absolutely.

528
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,520
Daniel Shanklin: Yep.

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,720
Daniel Shanklin: First the key.

530
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,520
Daniel Shanklin: First the egg.

531
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,800
Daniel Shanklin: I guess we'll go for it, gents.

532
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Daniel Shanklin: So.

533
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,640
Collin Bird - AIC: All right.

534
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,680
Collin Bird - AIC: Exactly.

535
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,400
Daniel Shanklin: All right, thanks.

536
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,040
Justin Charles: Thanks, guys.

537
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,800
Justin Charles: Thanks, guys.

538
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Justin Charles: See you.

539
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,520
Justin Charles: By.
